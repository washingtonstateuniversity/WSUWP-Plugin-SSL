# WSUWP TLS

A WordPress plugin to manage site specific TLS certificates on the WSUWP Platform.

WSUWP TLS maintains a list of domains awaiting TLS configuration on a multisite/multinetwork instance of WordPress through options stored in the primary site's `wp_options` table. A process is available for generating a domain's CSR and private key, uploading a matching certificate, creating an nginx server block, and in generalâ€”keeping track of the flow.

To take full advantage of the plugin by default, the following directories should be available and writeable by the user running WordPress:

* `/home/www-data/` - filtered through `wsuwp_tls_staging_dir`
* `/home/www-data/pending-cert/` - filtered through `wsuwp_tls_pending_cert_dir`
* `/home/www-data/to-deploy/` - filtered through `wsuwp_tls_to_deploy_dir`
* `/home/www-data/deployed/` - filtered through `wsuwp_tls_deployed_dir`
* `/home/www-data/complete/` - filtered through `wsuwp_tls_complete_dir`

An nginx configuration file will be generated in the staging directory (see above) with the server block(s) for the domain:

* `04_generated_config.conf` - filtered through `wsuwp_tls_nginx_config_file`

Matching deployment scripts should be created on the server, likely run via cron, to manage the deployment of certificates.

* On CSR and key generation, `.csr` and `.key` files will be in the pending certificate directory.
* Once a certificate for the domain is uploaded, the matching `.key` file and the uploaded `.cer` file will be moved by the plugin to the to deploy directory.
* At this point a cron script should manage the deployment of the `.key`, `.cer`, and nginx config files to their proper locations.
* Once deployed, the cron script should move the `.key` and `.cer` files to the deployed directory.
* Files will be moved from the deployed directory to the complete directory via the "Remove" action in the interface after confirmation of the working TLS config.
